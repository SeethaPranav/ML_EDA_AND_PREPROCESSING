# ML_EDA_AND_PREPROCESSING
A machine learning project focused on data preprocessing, including exploration, cleaning, encoding, and scaling of employee-related data for improved model performance.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on applying essential data preprocessing techniques to an employee-related dataset to prepare it for machine learning analysis. The primary goal is to enhance the quality, reliability, and usefulness of the data through various preprocessing steps. Key tasks in the project include:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the structure of the dataset, identifying unique values, performing statistical analysis, and renaming columns for clarity.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values, handling inappropriate data, removing duplicates, and detecting and dealing with outliers. Special handling is applied to columns like age and salary to ensure consistency.

3. **Data Analysis**: Filtering and analyzing the data based on specific criteria such as age and salary, and visualizing patterns in employee distribution by location.

4. **Data Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like label encoding for binary variables and one-hot encoding for nominal variables.

5. **Feature Scaling**: Standardizing and scaling the numerical features (age, salary) using techniques like StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

The project aims to build a robust data preprocessing pipeline that prepares raw data for use in machine learning models, improving both the quality and efficiency of model training.
